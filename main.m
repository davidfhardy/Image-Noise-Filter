% *PAPER:* Switching Bilateral Filter With a Texture/Noise Detector for
% Universal Noise Removal
%% Problem Formulation
% A key probelm in image processing is removing noise while keeping the
% other characteristics of the image intact. Image noise is the distorted
% exposure and colour information that a pixel may contain. An image's
% noise can be represented Gaussian noise and impulse noise. Gaussian noise
% is the noise distributed over an image's pixel under a normal
% distribution. Impulse noise is noise which is added to some portion of
% the image's pizels and is usually caused by transmission errors. There
% have been many filters designed to detect and correct impulse noise,
% however, it would be ideal to have a universal filter that can detect and
% remove both Gaussian and impulse noise.
%% Proposed Solution
% The proposed solution is to define a switching bilateral filter (SBF)
% which can detect both Gaussian and impulse noise and filter accordingly. 
%% Data Sources
%% Solutions
% First we distribute noise over the image.
I = imread('lena_image.png');
I = rgb2gray(I);    % Convert to a grayscale image 
subplot(3,2,1),imshow(I);
title('Original Image');

% Add Salt and Pepper Noise (Impulse noise)
sp_noise = 0.01;
Isp = imnoise(I, 'salt & pepper', sp_noise);
subplot(3,2,2),imshow(Isp);
title('Salt and Pepper Noise');

% Add Gaussian Noise
In = imnoise(Isp, 'gaussian');
subplot(3,2,3),imshow(In);
title('Gaussian and Salt & Pepper Noise');
Inew = In; % Inew will be the image where pixels are modified

% Then we apply the algorithm to filter the image
